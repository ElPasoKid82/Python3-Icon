# Python3-Icon
Attempt to create a desktop icon for Python 3 on Rasberry Pi
I am inviting comment from anyone who has successfully created a desktop icon as well as anyone learning with me. This does not launch the program as of yet, but perhaps some changes to the code can make this happen.
Thanks in advance for guidance and encouragement!
